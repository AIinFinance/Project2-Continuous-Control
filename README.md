Unity ML-Agents Reacher Environment 
</p>

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Download the Unity Environment

For this project, you will **not** need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

### Version 1: One (1) Agent
* Mac OSX: <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649452/Reacher.app.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (32-bit): <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649454/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (64-bit): <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649456/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip" download>click here</a>

### Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents
* Mac OSX: <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649402/Reacher.app.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (32-bit): <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649403/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip" download>click here</a>
* Windows (64-bit): <a href="https://github.com/AIinFinance/Project2-Continuous-Control/files/7649404/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip" download>click here</a>


Then, place the file in a folder in your GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

(For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

### Instructions

In order to train an agent, open `Reacher.ipynb` on Jupyter Notebook and run the code by pressing Shift+Enter or clicking Run button.
